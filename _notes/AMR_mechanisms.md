# Intrinsic resistance

3 main mechanisms:
* Reduce permeability of the outer membrane
* Selective exclusion *via* porins
* Efflux pumps

# Acquired resistance 
## Gain of enzymes
### Enzymes that degrade or modify the antimicrobials
* Example 1: β-lactamase enzyme degrading penicillin into fragments

* Example 2: Aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme (e.g. N-acetyltransferases) adding add an acetyl group (CH3CO) to kanamycin, stopping it binding to the ribosome
