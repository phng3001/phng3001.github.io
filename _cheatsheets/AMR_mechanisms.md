## Intrinsic resistance

3 main mechanisms:
* Reduce permeability of the outer membrane
* Selective exclusion *via* porins
* Efflux pumps

## Acquired resistance
### Gain of enzymes
#### Enzymes that degrade or modify the antimicrobial substance
* Example 1: β-lactamase enzyme degrading penicillin into fragments

* Example 2: Aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme (e.g. N-acetyltransferases) adding add an acetyl group (CH3CO) to kanamycin, stopping it binding to the ribosome

#### Enzymes that modify the target of the antimicrobial substance

Example: *erm* (Erythromycin Ribosomal Methylation) methylating to part of the ribosome which is the target of erythromycin

### Modification of the antimicrobial's target site by mutation

Example: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) modifying Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) which are the targets of penicillin

### Replacement of the antimicrobial's target site

Example: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  acquiring an extra copy of penicillin-binding protein 2, known as PBP2a

### Transcription modification: overproduction of the antimicrobial's target  or efflux pump

Example: Overproduction of dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) leading to sulfamethoxazole (SMX) resistance

### Modification of the cell membrane
* Acquirement of efflux pumps (e.g. TetA)
* Acquisition of mutations in porins or efflux pumps
