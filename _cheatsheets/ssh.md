## `ssh`: Connect to a remote server
```bash
ssh username@servername
```

## `ssh-keygen`: Generating SSH keys
```bash
# Generate an RSA 4096-bit key with "your_email@example.com" as a comment
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
* `-t`: Type of key (`rsa`, `ed25519`, `dsa`, `ecdsa`)
* `-b`: Number of bits in the key
* `-C`: Comment
> **Notes:** `ed25519` is often the best choice (small, fast, and secure). Its key size is fixed at 256 bits

### GitHub
