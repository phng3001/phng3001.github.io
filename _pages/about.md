I'm a microbiologist focused on translating omics data into biological insights.

I'm currently working in [Pr. Marc Ouellette's lab](https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/researcher/marc-ouellette/) in [the CHU de Québec - Université Laval Research Center](https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/) as a Research Associate.
