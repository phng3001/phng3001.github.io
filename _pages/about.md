I'm a microbiologist focused on translating omics data into biological insights.

I'm currently working as a Research Associate in [Professor Marc Ouellette’s lab](https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/researcher/marc-ouellette/) at [the CHU de Québec – Université Laval Research Center](https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/).

I earned a PhD in Process Engineering, specializing in Microbiology, from [AgroParisTech](https://www.agroparistech.fr/en), Paris-Saclay University (France). I then completed my postdoctoral training in my current lab, focusing on antimicrobial resistance in *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. 

Previously, I received an MSc in Molecular and Cellular Biology at [Pierre and Marie Curie University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) (France), and a BPharm at [Hanoi University of Pharmacy](https://www.hup.edu.vn/en) (Vietnam).

# Selected experiences

My omics journey began during my MSc internship at the GMPA (now SayFood) laboratory, where I conducted genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation of *Brevibacterium*, a bacterium widely used in surface-ripened cheeses for producing aroma compounds and red-orange pigments.
